Stream and spectate SSBM games directly in the browser!

This project is currently deployed at https://spectatormode.tv. The client program can be found at https://github.com/gcpreston/swb-rs.

## Client usage

To use SpectatorMode, you must run the client locally, which forwards Slippi data to the web server. To do so:

- Download the [client program](https://github.com/gcpreston/swb-rs/releases/latest)
- Open Slippi Dolphin
- Unarchive and launch the client

## Local development

The web server is built with Phoenix. To start the server locally:
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start the endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser. More information can be found in the [Phoenix installation and setup guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).

Instructions to connect the client to the local web server can be found in the [swb README](https://github.com/gcpreston/swb-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-options).
